# Feasibility of a manned Mars Mission

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My high-school research project, <a href="/pdf/TRDEFINITIVOv1.pdf">Colonies on Mars: Challenges and Solutions for the Conquest of the Red Planet</a>, examined whether it would be feasible, with 2019 technology, to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. The research began with an overview of Mars’ unique environment—its gravity, atmosphere, water resources, geology, and extreme climate—and then compared these factors with the state of the art in aerospace engineering and planetary science. This approach allowed me to evaluate mission architectures, habitat design, energy systems, and life-support strategies within a realistic framework.

One of the project’s distinctive features was the combination of theoretical analysis and a hands-on component. Alongside the written research, I designed and built a detailed 1:100 scale model of a proposed colony located in Jezero Crater, a site chosen for its scientific value and relative accessibility. The model incorporated a central habitat dome, supporting modules, transportation links, and energy infrastructure, reflecting the challenges of construction and resource management in a hostile environment.

The main conclusion of the project was that, while the dream of colonizing Mars continues to inspire, it remains beyond current technological and logistical capabilities. The absence of a reliable solution for <b>producing return-trip propellants</b> and the enormous infrastructure required are still significant barriers. Nevertheless, the project highlighted that many supporting technologies—such as life-support systems, renewable energy, and in-situ resource utilization—are progressing rapidly, bringing humanity closer to its first steps on the Red Planet.
