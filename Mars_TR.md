# Feasibility of a manned Mars Mission

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For more than 3 years during my bachelor, I regularly participated in the the <a href="https://roverchallenge.eu/">European Rover Challenge (ERC)</a> as a member of the <b>GRASS Mission</b> in <a href="https://www.upcprogram.space/">UPC Space Program</a>, an student association dedicated to various aerospace projects.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This competition allows students from all around the world to design, build and operate a robotic explorer simulating the Martian conditions expected for a space rover. The finals take place every year in Krakow, Poland. The team of which I formed part, the GRASS Mission inside the UPC Space Program, has participated in five consecutive editions since 2021, as the first Spanish team to classify in the history of the competition. To know the latest news of the project progress, I strongly recommend checking the association <a href="www.upcprogram.space/grass">website</a> and their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/upcspaceprogram?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">social media</a>
