# European Rover Challenge ‚Äì GRASS Mission (UPC Space Program)

For more than 3 years during my bachelor, I regularly participated in the **European Rover Challenge (ERC)** as a member of the **GRASS Mission** in the **UPC Space Program**, a student association dedicated to various aerospace projects.

This competition allows students from all around the world to design, build and operate a robotic explorer simulating the Martian conditions expected for a space rover. The finals take place every year in **Krakow, Poland**. The team of which I formed part, the GRASS Mission inside the UPC Space Program, has participated in five consecutive editions since 2021, as the **first Spanish team to classify in the history of the competition**.  
üëâ To know the latest news of the project progress, I strongly recommend checking the [association website](#) and their social media.

## My Story

### 2021 ‚Äì First Steps
My story inside this project started in **Summer 2021** during my first year of university, when I decided to join this student association who were planning, for the first time, to participate in the ERC, the biggest robotics competition in Europe.  

When I became a member, the team was finishing the building and testing of the first competition rover, the **GRASS v2**, and I got a chance to learn about the basic systems and the structure of the team.  

Although it was not the first rover of the GRASS Mission, it was undoubtedly the most complex and capable yet, as it had to fulfill all the requirements needed for the competition. Built from carbon fiber and 3D printed parts, it was equipped with a robotic arm, a first for the team, and a significantly complex element which would prove to be a recurrent engineering nightmare through the years.  

However, I always thought that the most important aspect of all the rovers was that they were **completely designed, built, programmed and tested by ourselves, the students**.  

Unfortunately, that first year I could not attend the competition (**ERC 2021**).

### 2022 ‚Äì The GRover
For the 2022 season I started motivated to design a completely new rover. The **GRASS v2**, although it had achieved an outstanding 10th position, was far from perfect, and the team decided to scratch the design and start anew.  

The new rover, the **GRover**, was an impressive step up from the previous design:  
- **Suspension** redesigned, opting for a *rocker-bogie* design inspired by Mars rovers such as *Curiosity* or *Perseverance*.  
- **Electronics** enclosed into an aluminum modular structure.  
- **Materials**: carbon fiber replaced with steel and 3D printed parts.  
- **Robotic arm** redesigned as part of a bachelor thesis.  
- **Programming and autonomy** improved significantly.  

With these modifications, we classified and achieved a very rewarding **9th position in ERC 2022**, which also marked my first attendance at the competition.  

Additionally, I became **Structure Department Coordinator**, supervising and helping with subsystem tasks.

### 2023 ‚Äì The GRover-To
For the 2023 season we designed the **GRover-To**.  

That year I became **Mission Coordinator**, while still working in the Structures Department. Although it looked similar to the previous rover, it was a **completely different machine**, with:  
- **New additive manufacturing techniques**, such as SLS.  
- Improved **suspension, electronics, structure, and robotic arm**.  
- New **drill module** (competition requirement).  
- An **autonomous drone** intended to land on the rover.  

Despite these advances, the competition was becoming increasingly demanding, with stronger international teams. Combined with technical difficulties, we finished with a **16th position**.

### 2024 ‚Äì The GAIA Rover
In my fourth season, we designed the **GAIA rover**, with the objective of simplifying and streamlining subsystems:  
- Removed the rocker-bogie suspension.  
- Redesigned the robotic arm.  
- Made the rover lighter and stronger.  
- Focused on **control and autonomy**.  

Unlike previous rovers, GAIA was designed to be used in multiple seasons. It was the **best performing rover to date**, proving the experience and ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù gained by the team.  

However, the growing standards of the competition placed us behind more experienced teams, ending with a **20th position**. This was bittersweet, as I knew this would probably be my last season.

## Conclusion
Looking back, my participation in the **European Rover Challenge** through the **GRASS Mission** has been one of the most transformative experiences of my academic journey.  

Beyond the technical knowledge gained in design, structures, and systems engineering, what I value the most is the **teamwork, resilience, and leadership skills** developed throughout the years.  

Each rover was not only a machine, but also a **testimony of the passion and dedication of dozens of students** who shared the same vision. Although challenges and setbacks were always present, they pushed us to improve and to aim higher, both as engineers and as a team.  

For me, the ERC was not just a competition‚Äîit was a **defining experience where I grew into the professional I aspire to become**.
