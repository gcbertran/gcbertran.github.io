## European Rover Challenge

For the past two years I have been regularly participating in the <a href="https://www.roverchallenge.eu">European Rover Challenge</a> (ERC) as a member of the <a href="https://www.upcprogram.space">UPC Space Program</a>. This competition allows students from all around the world to design, build and operate a robotic explorer simulating the Martian conditions expected for a space rover. The finals take place every year in Kielce, Poland. Our team, the GRASS mission inside the UPC Space Program, has participated in two consecutive editions, achieving the 10th and 9th position, respectively. In this edition, the **ERC 2023**, our team is participating with its latest rover, the **GRoverTo**. More info is available in the association website and in our social media.

Since I started this project as a member of the Structures Department back in 2021, I have developed many useful skills that I currently use in my everyday, such as SolidWorks, 3D Printing and design skills. In 2022, I was promoted to Coordinator of the Structures Department, and I developed my project management and problem-solving skills. I also got more involved in the documentation process of the project, as well as in the advertising aspect, as I became a member of the Marketing & Communications Department. Currently, I am the Coordinator of the Mission, and I am apllying all these skills into this year's project, the GRoverTo.
