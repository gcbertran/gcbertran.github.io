## Bachelor's Thesis: Design and Testing of Deployable Solar Arrays for PocketQubes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As part of the Final Thesis of my Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering, I designed, built, and tested a deployable solar array system for <b>PocketQubes</b>, a fast-growing standard in the nanosatellite market, in collaboration with the HORUS Mission in the <b>UPC Space Program</b>. The project, titled <a href="/pdf/TFG_Report.pdf">Design and Testing of Folding Solar Cell Arrays for PocketQubes</a>, focused on overcoming the power limitations of small satellites by creating a cost-effective and reliable folding solar panel system, easily manufacturable with COTS components and 3D printing, paving the way of PocketQube structure builing to very reduced budgets.

The methodology involved an iterative design process using SolidWorks and a series of 3D-printed prototypes. I conducted extensive structural and modal analysis simulations in ANSYS to ensure the design's resilience to the expected launch conditions. Additionally, I performed <b>random vibration tests</b> on the final prototype to validate its functionality and compliance with space mission standards.

The project's final design incorporates a functional <b>Hold Down Release Mechanism (HDRM)</b> and a scalable structure adaptable for various PocketQube configurations. This work not only contributes to the advancement of accessible space technologies but also aligns with sustainable practices by promoting the use of smallsats that naturally de-orbit, thus mitigating space debris. This project helped me develop my skills in mechanical design, structural analysis, and practical prototyping, as well as project organization, culminating in a functional solution with real-world applications.
