## Final Degree Project: Design and Testing of Deployable Solar Arrays for PocketQubes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As part of my Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering, I designed, built, and tested a deployable solar array system for PocketQubes, a fast-growing standard in the nanosatellite market. The project, titled <a href="/pdf/TFG.pdf">Design and Testing of Folding Solar Cell Arrays for PocketQubes</a>, focused on overcoming the power limitations of small satellites by creating a cost-effective and reliable folding solar panel system.

The methodology involved an iterative design process using SolidWorks and a series of 3D-printed prototypes. I conducted extensive structural and modal analysis simulations in ANSYS to ensure the design's resilience to launch conditions. Additionally, I performed vibration tests on the final prototype to validate its functionality and compliance with space mission standards.

The project's final design incorporates a functional Hold Down Release Mechanism and a scalable structure adaptable for various PocketQube configurations. This work not only contributes to the advancement of accessible space technologies but also aligns with sustainable practices by promoting the use of smallsats that naturally de-orbit, thus mitigating space debris. This project is a testament to my skills in mechanical design, structural analysis, and practical prototyping, culminating in a functional solution with real-world applications.
