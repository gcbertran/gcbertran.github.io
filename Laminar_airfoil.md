# Study of a laminar airfoil in incompressible flow

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As part of my Fluids Mechanics coursework at UPC, I conducted a computational study of the <b>Wortmann FX 66-S-196 V1</b> laminar airfoil, widely used in gliders such as the LS1. The project focused on analyzing aerodynamic performance at low Reynolds numbers, with the objective of understanding laminar flow behavior and its transition to turbulence. You can see the complete report here.

I created the mesh using <b>Gmsh</b> and performed CFD simulations in <b>OpenFOAM</b>, later visualized and analyzed with ParaView. Simulations were carried out at different angles of attack (0°, 9°, and 15°), showing laminar behavior, delayed transition with optimal efficiency, and stall conditions, respectively.

To validate the results, I compared them with simulations in <b>XFLR5</b> (XFoil-based), obtaining strong agreement in lift, drag, and Cp distribution. Additionally, I modeled the LS1 glider to evaluate its sink rate, achieving results close to experimental values.

This project not only reinforced my understanding of laminar airfoils and boundary layer dynamics, but also helped me gain hands-on experience with CFD tools such as OpenFOAM, ParaView, and XFLR5.
